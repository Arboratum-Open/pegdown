Introduction
------------

_pegdown_ is a pure Java library for clean and lightweight [Markdown] processing.
It's implementation is based on a [parboiled] PEG parser and is therefore rather easy to understand and extend.

_pegdown_ is nearly 100% compatible with the original Markdown specification and fully passes the original Markdown test suite.
On top of the standard Markdown feature set _pegdown_ implements a number of extensions similar to what other popular Markdown processors offer.  
Currently _pegdown_ supports the following extensions over standard Markdown:

* SMARTS: Beautifies apostrophes, ellipses ("..." and ". . .") and dashes ("--" and "---")
* QUOTES: Beautifies single quotes, double quotes and double angle quotes (&laquo; and &raquo;)
* SMARTYPANTS: Convenience extension enabling both, SMARTS and QUOTES, at once.
* ABBREVIATIONS: Abbreviations in the way of [PHP Markdown Extra].
* HARDWRAPS: Alternative handling of newlines, see [Github-flavoured-Markdown]
* AUTOLINKS: Plain (undelimited) autolinks the way [Github-flavoured-Markdown] implements them.
* TABLES: Tables similar to [MultiMarkdown] (which is in turn like the [PHP Markdown Extra] tables, but with colspan support).
* DEFINITION LISTS: Definition lists in the way of [PHP Markdown Extra].
* FENCED CODE BLOCKS: Fenced Code Blocks in the way of [PHP Markdown Extra] or [Github-flavoured-Markdown].
* HTML BLOCK SUPPRESSION: Suppresses the output of HTML blocks.
* INLINE HTML SUPPRESSION: Suppresses the output of inline HTML elements.
* WIKILINKS: Support `[[Wiki-style links]]` with a customizable URL rendering logic.

Note: _pegdown_ differs from the original Markdown in that it ignores in-word emphasis as in

    > my_cool_file.txt
    > 2*3*4=5

Currently this "extension" cannot be switched off.


Installation
------------

You have two options:

* Download the JAR for the latest version from the [download page].
  _pegdown_ 1.1.0 has only one dependency: [parboiled for Java][parboiled], version 1.0.2.
   
* Point your Maven-compatible build tool to the repository at <http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases>,
  group id "**org.pegdown**", artifact "**pegdown**".    
  There may also be snapshot builds available at <http://scala-tools.org/repo-snapshots>. 


Usage
-----

Using _pegdown_ is very simple: Just create a new instance of a [PegDownProcessor] and call one of its
`markdownToHtml` methods to convert the given Markdown source to an HTML string. If you'd like to customize the
rendering of HTML links (Auto-Links, Explicit-Links, Mail-Links, Reference-Links and/or Wiki-Links), e.g. for adding
`rel="nofollow"` attributes based on some logic you can supply your own instance of a [LinkRenderer] with the call
to `markdownToHtml`.

You can also use pegdown only for the actual parsing of the Markdown source and do the serialization to the
target format (e.g. XML) yourself. To do this just call the `parseMarkdown` method of the [PegDownProcessor] to obtain
the root node of the Astract Syntax Tree for the document.
With a custom [Visitor] implementation you can do whatever serialization you want. As an example you might want to
take a look at the [sources of the ToHtmlSerializer][ToHtmlSerializer].

Note that the first time you create a [PegDownProcessor] it can take up to a few hundred milliseconds to prepare the
underlying parboiled parser instance. However, once the first processor has been built all further instantiations will
be fast. Also, you can reuse an existing [PegDownProcessor] instance as often as you want, as long as you prevent
concurrent accesses, since neither the [PegDownProcessor] nor the underlying parser is thread-safe.

See <http://sirthias.github.com/pegdown/api> for the pegdown API documation.


IDE Support
-----------

The excellent [idea-markdown plugin] for IntelliJ IDEA, RubyMine, PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm and appCode uses _pegdown_ as its underlying parsing engine. The plugin gives you proper syntax-highlighting for markdown source and shows you exactly, how _pegdown_ will parse your texts.


Hacking on pegdown
------------------

pegdown uses [Apache Buildr] for managing the build process. However, if you do not want to
install Buildr on your machine, it should be no problem to quickly set up a project structure for the IDE of your choice
around the sources, since they are quite compact and the dependencies are few.

In order to provide custom markdown extensions to pegdown you shouldn't even have to get your hands dirty with its
sources. A [PegDownProcessor] can be constructed around a given Parser instance, so you can supply your own.
If you want to go that way probably want to subclass the _org.pegdown.Parser_ class and override a limited
number of rules to inject your own extensions. Your extensions can create custom [Node] implementations, which you can process through the general `visit(Node)` method of a custom [Visitor] implementation.
